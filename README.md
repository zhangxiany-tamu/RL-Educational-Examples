# Reinforcement Learning Educational Examples

Educational implementations of reinforcement learning algorithms with clear explanations and runnable code.

## Current Examples

### Tic-Tac-Toe Q-Learning
A complete implementation demonstrating Q-Learning fundamentals including state representation, epsilon-greedy exploration, and tabular methods.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib jupyter
```

### Usage
1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to `01-tic-tac-toe-q-learning`
3. Run the Jupyter notebook for interactive learning
4. Or run the Python script to play against the trained AI:
   ```bash
   python tic_tac_toe_game.py
   ```

### Playing Against the AI
The Python script will:
- Train a Q-learning agent (takes a few minutes)
- Let you play interactive games against the trained AI
- You can choose to go first or let the AI go first
- Enter positions 1-9 to make your moves

## Structure

Each example includes:
- README with learning objectives
- Jupyter notebook with explanations
- Standalone Python implementation
