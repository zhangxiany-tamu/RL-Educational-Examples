# Reinforcement Learning Educational Examples

A curated collection of reinforcement learning examples designed for educational purposes. This repository focuses on providing clear, well-documented implementations that demonstrate core RL concepts.

## 🎯 Current Examples

### 📚 Beginner Level

#### 1. **Tic-Tac-Toe Q-Learning** 🎮
**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Concepts:** Q-Learning fundamentals, epsilon-greedy, state representation, tabular methods

Perfect starting point for learning RL! This example demonstrates:
- Basic Q-Learning algorithm implementation
- State representation for game environments
- Exploration vs exploitation with epsilon-greedy strategy
- Training an agent to play Tic-Tac-Toe from scratch

## 🚀 Future Examples

More examples will be added to cover intermediate and advanced RL topics including:
- Deep Q-Networks (DQN) for continuous state spaces
- Policy-based methods (REINFORCE, Actor-Critic)
- Model-based approaches (Dynamic Programming)
- Advanced topics (Monte Carlo methods, Multi-agent RL)

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib jupyter
# For future examples: gym, torch, etc.
```

### Quick Start
1. Clone or download this repository
2. Start with **01-tic-tac-toe-q-learning**
3. Follow the README in the example folder
4. Run the Jupyter notebook for interactive learning

## 📋 Example Structure

Each example follows a consistent structure:
```
example-folder/
├── README.md          # Overview and learning objectives
├── notebook.ipynb     # Interactive tutorial (when available)
├── script.py          # Standalone implementation
└── requirements.txt   # Dependencies (when needed)
```

## 🎓 Educational Philosophy
