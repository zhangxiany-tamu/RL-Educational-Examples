# Tic-Tac-Toe Q-Learning

## Overview
This example demonstrates **Q-Learning** fundamentals using the classic game of tic-tac-toe. Perfect for understanding basic reinforcement learning concepts.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Understand Q-Learning algorithm and Q-table structure
- Learn epsilon-greedy exploration vs exploitation
- See how states are represented (Markovian property)
- Experience training vs playing behavior differences

## 📁 Files
- `tic_tac_toe_rl.ipynb` - Interactive Jupyter notebook with detailed explanations
- `tic_tac_toe_game.py` - Standalone Python script for terminal play

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Jupyter Notebook (Recommended)
```bash
jupyter notebook tic_tac_toe_rl.ipynb
```

### Option 2: Terminal Game
```bash
python tic_tac_toe_game.py
```

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered

### Q-Learning Algorithm
- **Q-table**: Stores quality values for state-action pairs
- **Bellman equation**: Q(s,a) ← Q(s,a) + α[r + γ·max(Q(s',a')) - Q(s,a)]
- **Temporal difference learning**: Learn from prediction errors

### State Representation
- **Markovian states**: Only current board matters (not move history)
- **Sparse Q-table**: Only stores encountered states (~3000 out of 19,683 possible)
- **State format**: String representation of 3x3 board

### Exploration vs Exploitation
- **Epsilon-greedy policy**: Balance learning new strategies vs using known good moves
- **Epsilon decay**: Start with 10% exploration, decay to 1% over time
- **Training vs Playing**: Exploration during training, pure greedy when playing

## 🎮 Training Process
1. **Random starting player**: Agent learns both offensive and defensive strategies
2. **Experience collection**: Store (state, action, player) tuples during gameplay
3. **Backward learning**: Update Q-values for all agent moves after game ends
4. **Progressive improvement**: ~80% win rate against random opponent after 10,000 episodes

## 🏆 Results
- **Final win rate**: ~80% against random opponent
- **Balanced learning**: ~50% first player, ~50% second player during training
- **Strategic knowledge**: Learns center/corner preferences, blocking, winning moves

## 💡 Educational Value
This example provides a concrete, visual introduction to reinforcement learning that's easy to understand and experiment with. The game rules are simple, but the learning process demonstrates all key RL concepts.

## 🔄 Extensions to Try
- Train against different opponents (minimax, human players)
- Experiment with different hyperparameters (α, γ, ε)
- Implement other RL algorithms (SARSA, Monte Carlo)
- Add more sophisticated state representations
